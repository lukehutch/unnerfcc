apply-unnerfs.py — Re-apply every un-nerf in this repo to a system-prompts tree.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
tweakcc extracts Claude Code's system prompts into editable `.md` files so they
can be hand-patched. Whenever tweakcc re-runs against a newer Claude Code
binary (new ccVersion), it overwrites every changed prompt with fresh STOCK
text — wiping any un-nerfs applied on top. This script idempotently re-applies
every un-nerf against the current working copy of `system-prompts/`, restoring
the full un-nerfed state.

USAGE
-----
    python scripts/apply-unnerfs.py                  # apply to ./system-prompts/
    python scripts/apply-unnerfs.py --dir PATH       # target another directory
    python scripts/apply-unnerfs.py --dry-run        # report without writing
    python scripts/apply-unnerfs.py --check          # exit 1 if anything would change
    python scripts/apply-unnerfs.py --only FILE      # restrict to one filename
    python scripts/apply-unnerfs.py --verbose        # include context on skipped rules

EXIT CODES
----------
    0  — no failures, no missing files
    1  — at least one rule failed to apply OR at least one file was missing
         (in --check mode, 1 also means "at least one rule would apply")
    2  — invalid invocation (e.g. --dir doesn't exist)

ADDING A NEW RULE (FOR A FUTURE CLAUDE CODE VERSION BUMP)
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Run this script first. Read the [FAIL] section — it names every file whose
   expected stock text isn't in the working copy anymore.
2. For each failure:
   a. Open the file and find the new stock text that replaced the old one.
   b. Craft the un-nerfed replacement (typically: flip brevity → thoroughness
      per the repo's README thesis).
   c. Update the relevant RULES[filename] entry: change the `stock` string to
      the new upstream text; keep or update the `unnerf` string.
3. For brand-new files (ccVersion = the new release, no predecessor): decide
   whether any un-nerf applies. Many new prompts are structured data generators
   (inbox summaries, classification outputs) where length caps are UX-driven,
   not brevity-nerf-driven — those should be left stock. Add a rule only when
   a brevity directive for *implementation*, *process*, or *thoroughness*
   (per the README's bucket taxonomy) is present.
4. Re-run the script. Confirm all entries report [APPLIED] or [SKIP].
5. Commit both the rule change and the re-applied prompt files together.

HOW A RULE WORKS
----------------
Each rule is a (stock, unnerf, description) triple keyed by filename. The
script:
  - If `stock` is present in the file → replace it (once) with `unnerf`. Result: APPLIED.
  - Else if `unnerf` is present → no-op (rule already applied earlier). Result: SKIP.
  - Else → loud failure. Result: FAIL, with the expected stock text quoted so
    the reader knows exactly what to search for and update.

This idempotency is intentional: you can run the script repeatedly, after any
tweakcc re-extract, and it will converge to the un-nerfed state regardless of
how many un-nerfs were already in place.

REPORT FORMAT (READ BY CLAUDE AND HUMANS)
-----------------------------------------
For each file:
    system-prompts/<filename>
      [APPLIED] <rule description>
      [SKIP]    <rule description>                     — already un-nerfed
      [FAIL]    <rule description>
                Expected stock text (first 200 chars):
                  '...'
                Neither stock nor unnerf text found in file.
                Action: open the file, locate the relevant passage, and update
                the RULES entry's `stock` field to match the new upstream wording.

And a final `=== Summary ===` block with totals + exit code.

# ============================================================================
# RULES — the full un-nerf inventory, grouped by filename.
# ============================================================================
# Each entry is a list of Rule objects. Order matters only when rules within
# the same file could overlap textually; in this repo, rules within a file are
# always paragraph-distinct, so any order works. New entries go at the bottom
# of each list for easy diffing.
#
# STYLE NOTES:
#   - Use Python triple-quoted strings for multi-line rules. Anything inside
#     the `stock`/`unnerf` quotes is byte-exact — preserve trailing whitespace
#     and line breaks exactly as they appear in the file.
#   - Describe each rule in terms of what it *does* (flip-to-thorough, restore
#     subagent-liberally, etc.) so the report is scannable.
#   - When upstream drifts (a bumped ccVersion), update `stock` to match the
#     new text. The `unnerf` typically stays the same unless the new upstream
#     text is structurally different.
