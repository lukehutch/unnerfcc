# The un-nerf guide — objectives & upgrade playbook

This is the single source of truth for **what this project is trying to do** and
**how to upgrade it when Anthropic ships a new Claude Code version**. If you are
re-running the sync against a newer Claude Code, read Part 1 (so you make the
right keep/flip calls) then follow Part 2 (the workflow). The later parts are the
reference detail behind each step.

> Companion docs: [README](README.md) (what/why for users), [MAINTENANCE](MAINTENANCE.md)
> (script flags), [BACKGROUND](BACKGROUND.md) (history, how tweakcc works).
> This guide supersedes and unifies the "upgrade" material in those.

## Part 1 — The objective

Claude Code's stock prompts contain far more instructions to **be brief** than to
**be thorough** — roughly 5:1. That imbalance makes the model cut corners on real
work. This project rebalances it. The goal is **not verbosity** — it is
**thoroughness**. The stock prompts conflate the two; they are not the same.

Every stock brevity directive falls into one of four buckets. The whole project
is one rule applied consistently:

> **Keep bucket 1. Flip buckets 2 and 3. Amplify bucket 4.**

| # | Bucket | What it controls | Action | Example |
|---|--------|------------------|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Chat brevity** | length of conversational replies to trivial asks | **KEEP** | "respond in 2-3 sentences", "a terse one-liner is fine" for *what's the git status* |
| 2 | **Implementation brevity** | the *code* Claude writes | **FLIP** | "don't add abstractions", "simplest approach", "don't gold-plate", "do the minimum" |
| 3 | **Process brevity** | how Claude *investigates and reports to a human* | **FLIP** | "as quickly as possible", "report back concisely", "2-sentence summary", "briefly explain" |
| 4 | **Thoroughness** | "think step by step", "consider edge cases" | **AMPLIFY** | already pro-quality — strengthen it |

### The keep/flip decision procedure

When a prompt contains a brevity-signature phrase, decide with this checklist
(in order — the first match wins):

1. **Is the output a structured artifact or machine-parsed?** A title, branch
   name, commit message, JSON object, classification label, autocomplete
   suggestion, a status string parsed by a script, a notification with an
   explicit character cap. → **KEEP.** Length here is UX/format, not work depth.
   (`agent-prompt-session-title-and-branch-generation`, `system-prompt-insights-*`,
   `agent-prompt-workflow-subagent-plain-text-output`.)
2. **Is it a functional constraint?** "minimal `old_string` for uniqueness",
   "no preamble before the *required* tool call", "avoid sleep-polling",
   "CLAUDE.md must be concise" (it loads into every session). → **KEEP.** The
   brevity is doing real mechanical work.
3. **Is it safety / security?** Deny-rules, confirmation gates, classifier
   guidance. → **KEEP** (or make *stricter* — never weaker). A *fuller*
   explanation that helps a human's safety decision is a legitimate flip of the
   *explanation*, not the gate (see `system-prompt-troubleshooting-confirmation-policy`).
4. **Is it reference / documentation / example content?** Every `data-*.md` blob,
   API docs, sample prompts quoted inside a guide. → **KEEP.** A length cap
   *inside an example* is not a directive to Claude.
5. **Otherwise — does it cap engineering depth or human-facing reporting?**
   "simplest approach", "don't add/refactor/abstract", "investigate as quickly as
   possible", "keep your report short", a 2-sentence cap on an end-of-turn or
   subagent-to-human summary. → **FLIP** to thoroughness.

The hardest calls are subagent prompts: a subagent's report **to a human or to an
orchestrating agent that needs detail** should be thorough (flip), but a subagent
whose output is **parsed by a workflow script** should stay concise (keep). Same
word, opposite call — decide by *who consumes the output*.

When you flip, write the replacement in the project's voice: lead with the
*requirement* ("Make your review exhaustive…"), not the prohibition; preserve any
genuinely-good clause already present (safety caveats, "never half-finished");
keep it about **depth and completeness**, never about padding word count.

---

## Part 2 — The upgrade workflow (happy path)

When Anthropic ships Claude Code `X.Y.Z` and tweakcc has published
`prompts-X.Y.Z.json` (usually within hours — see Part 8):

```bash
# 0. one-time: install the gray-matter dep the sync script uses
cd scripts && npm install --ignore-scripts --save-exact && cd ..

# 1. Rebuild STOCK prompts for the new version AND auto-diff the checksum manifest.
#    This overwrites system-prompts/*.md with stock and rewrites
#    system-prompt-checksums.json. The diff it prints IS your review worklist.
node scripts/sync-version.mjs X.Y.Z --download

# 2. Replay the un-nerfs onto the fresh stock.
python3 scripts/apply-unnerfs.py

# 3. Read the apply report. Any [FAIL] = a rule whose stock text drifted (Part 6).
#    Fix rules until the report is all APPLIED/SKIP, then gate:
python3 scripts/apply-unnerfs.py --check    # exit 0 = idempotent & clean

# 4. Review the manifest diff from step 1 (Part 5):
#      CHANGED with a rule  -> apply-unnerfs already told you (FAIL) if it drifted
#      CHANGED without rule -> grep-triage + read; flip if it's a new bucket-2/3 nerf
#      ADDED                -> grep-triage + read each; most data-*/structured = keep
#      REMOVED              -> retire the rule(s) targeting it
git diff system-prompts/ system-prompt-checksums.json   # eyeball before committing

# 5. (optional, recommended) verify against the actually-installed binary (Part 7)

# 6. Commit the stock+un-nerf+manifest+rule changes together (Part 2, "commit").
```

**What `sync-version.mjs` prints (the key new behavior).** On every run it diffs
the freshly-generated stock against the manifest from the *previous* sync and
reports `CHANGED / ADDED / REMOVED / unchanged`, then rewrites the manifest for
the new version. This is the authoritative "what did Anthropic change" list —
and crucially it is **clean**: because it fingerprints *stock*, it is not
polluted by your own un-nerf edits the way `git diff` on the un-nerfed tree is.

If tweakcc has **not** published `prompts-X.Y.Z.json` yet, you can't run the
happy path — see Part 8 ("the publish lag") for what to do.

### Committing

Stage the prompt tree, the manifest, and any rule changes together:

```bash
git add system-prompts/ system-prompt-checksums.json scripts/apply-unnerfs.py
git commit   # message: "sync prompts to Claude Code vX.Y.Z (+/- rules, manifest)"
```

Commit while the diff is small and the context is fresh. Note in the message any
rules retired (removed prompts) or added (new nerfs), and any FAILs you resolved.

---

## Part 3 — Reading the prompts (where stock text comes from)

Claude Code ships as a compiled Bun **native binary** with its prompts baked in
as string literals. There are two ways to get the stock text:

### A. tweakcc's published JSON (the normal source)

tweakcc publishes one `prompts-X.Y.Z.json` per supported CC version at
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Piebald-AI/tweakcc/refs/heads/main/data/prompts/`.
Each prompt object is `{ id, name, description, version, pieces[], identifiers[],
identifierMap }`. The `.md` body is reconstructed by interleaving `pieces` with
`${HUMAN_NAME}` placeholders from `identifierMap`; the frontmatter is `name`,
`description`, `ccVersion` (the version when *that prompt* last changed — **not**
the global CC version), and `variables`. `scripts/sync-version.mjs` does exactly
this, byte-identically to a tweakcc extraction.

> tweakcc does **not** publish every patch release, and a fresh release can lag by
> hours-to-days. If the JSON for your installed version isn't up yet, see Part 8
> ("the publish lag") — but the normal case is that the latest version is available.

### B. The installed binary, via `tweakcc unpack` (ground truth, version-independent)

`tweakcc unpack` extracts the bundled JS from *any* installed binary without
needing published JSON — useful to (a) verify the JSON-derived prompts actually
match what you're running, and (b) inspect a version tweakcc hasn't published.

```bash
CCBIN="$(readlink -f "$(command -v claude)")"   # e.g. .../@anthropic-ai/claude-code/bin/claude.exe
npx --yes tweakcc@latest unpack /tmp/cc.js "$CCBIN"   # writes ~17 MB of JS; reads only, non-destructive
```

You then search that JS for prompt text. **Escaping gotcha:** the minified JS
stores non-ASCII as escapes — em-dash `—` → `—`, and **Latin-1 U+0080–U+00FF
→ `\xHH`** (e.g. `·` → `\xb7`, `×` → `\xd7`). A naive `grep` for a phrase
containing those will miss. To match reliably, search on the longest **pure-ASCII
run** of a piece (no `` ` `` `"` `\` newline), or build an escape-aware regex
(`for each char>127: (literal|\uXXXX|\xHH)`; newlines as `(\n|literal)`). This
`\xHH` case will silently swallow any prompt whose only distinctive text contains one.

---

## Part 4 — Detecting what changed (the MD5 manifest)

`system-prompt-checksums.json` records the MD5 of every **stock** `.md` for the
currently-synced version. It is the project's memory of "what the upstream
prompts looked like last time," so a version bump can answer precisely: which
stock prompts changed, which are new, which are gone.

- **What's hashed:** the full stock `.md` (frontmatter + body). An untouched
  prompt keeps the same `ccVersion` and is byte-identical across CC versions →
  identical MD5; any change to body *or* metadata flips it. (A pure `ccVersion`
  re-stamp with an otherwise-identical body *will* flip the hash — that's a
  conservative false-positive, not a miss. Confirm with a quick `diff`.)
- **It is STOCK hashes, not the un-nerfed files** committed in `system-prompts/`.
  Pointing a hasher at the un-nerfed tree reports the un-nerfs as "changed" — by
  design. This separation is the whole point: `git diff` on the un-nerfed tree
  mixes "Anthropic reworded this" with "my un-nerf is being reverted"; the
  manifest diff shows only Anthropic's changes.
- **Who writes it:** `sync-version.mjs` (automatically, from the stock it holds
  in memory before any un-nerf runs). For the binary-extraction fallback, the
  standalone tool writes it from a stock dir:

```bash
# Diff a stock tree against the manifest (read-only):
node scripts/prompt-checksums.mjs --dir <stock-dir>
# CI gate — exit 1 if a stock tree drifts from the manifest:
node scripts/prompt-checksums.mjs --dir <stock-dir> --check
# (Re)write the manifest for a version:
node scripts/prompt-checksums.mjs --dir <stock-dir> --ccVersion X.Y.Z --write
```

`--dir` must point at **stock** prompts (a tweakcc extraction or a
`sync-version.mjs --target` output), never the un-nerfed `system-prompts/`.

---

## Part 5 — Reviewing prompts for nerfs

Two passes: the **delta** (what changed this version) and, periodically, a **full
sweep** (catch nerfs missed in prior versions). The manifest narrows the delta to
just CHANGED+ADDED; the full sweep is reproducible via grep-triage.

### Delta review

From the manifest diff (Part 4): for each **CHANGED** file, if it has a rule,
`apply-unnerfs.py` already told you via FAIL whether the rule's target drifted.
If it has no rule, or is ADDED, grep it for brevity signatures and read the hits
in context, then apply the Part-1 decision procedure.

### Full-sweep triage (grep)

```bash
PAT='be (brief|concise|terse)|keep (it|your response) (brief|short|concise)|as (quickly|briefly) as|minimal (explanation|detail|response)|do(n.t| not) (add|over-explain|gold-plate|elaborate)|simplest (approach|solution)|the minimum|[12]-?[0-9]? sentence|no preamble|avoid (verbosity|being verbose)|terse|succinct'
# files that mention brevity but have NO rule (candidate missed nerfs):
comm -23 <(grep -rliE "$PAT" <stock-dir>/*.md | xargs -n1 basename | sort) \
         <(grep -oE '"[^"]+\.md"' scripts/apply-unnerfs.py | tr -d '"' | sort -u)
# then read the matching lines and judge each against Part 1:
grep -inE "$PAT" <stock-dir>/<candidate>.md
```

Most candidates resolve to **keep** (structured output, reference blobs,
functional uses of "minimal"/"short"). Only a real bucket-2/3 directive that
degrades engineering work or human-facing reporting gets a rule. Be conservative
— a false flip is worse than a miss.

For maximum confidence on a big sweep, partition the prompt set by category
(`system-prompt-*`, `agent-prompt-*`, `tool-description-*`, `skill-*` +
`system-reminder-*`, `data-*`) and review each slice independently against the
Part-1 buckets — `data-*` is almost always all-keep (reference blobs).

---

## Part 6 — Updating the rules

Un-nerfs live in `scripts/apply-unnerfs.py` as `Rule(stock, unnerf, description)`
triples keyed by filename. The script finds `stock` and replaces it with `unnerf`
(idempotent: if `unnerf` is already present it SKIPs; if neither is found it
FAILs).

### Adding a rule

```python
"system-prompt-foo.md": [
    Rule(
        stock="<exact stock text, byte-for-byte, incl. ${VARS} and \n>",
        unnerf="<thorough replacement in the project's voice>",
        description="<short scannable label of what it flips>",
    ),
],
```

- `stock` must be **byte-exact**: preserve `${VAR}` interpolations, trailing
  whitespace, and embedded `\n` newlines. Verify with
  `grep -cF "<phrase>" system-prompts/<file>.md` (use a single-line ASCII
  substring; for newline-spanning targets verify in Python:
  `'a\nb' in open(f).read()`).
- Prefer a **short, unique** stock substring over a whole paragraph — it's less
  likely to drift on the next version, and uniqueness-within-the-file is all the
  matcher needs.
- **Quote/escape safety:** an un-nerf containing `"` inside a `${"..."}` literal
  can break things; non-idempotent rules where `unnerf` contains `stock` verbatim
  will re-apply forever — avoid both. Gate with `--check`.

### Handling FAILs (drift) and structural changes

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Upstream **reworded** the passage | Update the rule's `stock` to the new wording (the `unnerf` usually stands). |
| Upstream **removed** the passage/prompt | **Retire** the rule (delete it; note in commit). |
| Upstream moved the passage into a `${VARIABLE}` | **Retire** — the variable's value isn't in any extracted `.md`, so tweakcc's patcher (it replaces static `pieces` and treats `${VARS}` as wildcards) can't reach it. |
| Upstream **replaced** brevity with neutral/pro-thorough text | Retire the rule — the nerf is gone. |
| A prompt was **renamed** | **Retarget**: move the rule to the new filename key (e.g. `skill-simplify.md` → `agent-prompt-simplify-slash-command.md`). |

Confirm the same flip isn't needed in a **sibling** prompt — Claude Code often
duplicates a sentence across related prompts, and rules are per-file. Don't
eyeball this — run the **exhaustive sibling audit**: import `RULES`, and for each
rule grep its `stock` across every stock `.md`; any match in a file that *isn't*
the rule's own key is an un-ruled sibling to flip (unless the match is
example/reference content — e.g. a sample prompt quoted inside a guide, which
stays). The current audit finds **0 un-ruled siblings**: every cross-file `stock` match
is already ruled in both files, except the intentional `skill-model-migration-guide`
keep — that phrase sits inside a sample prompt quoted for users (example content,
not a directive to Claude). See Part 9.

---

## Part 7 — Verifying against the installed binary

The manifest/`apply-unnerfs` loop proves the rules apply to the *JSON-derived*
stock. To prove the prompts match what you're actually **running** (and to catch
a patch release that changed prompts the published JSON doesn't yet cover):

```bash
CCBIN="$(readlink -f "$(command -v claude)")"
npx --yes tweakcc@latest unpack /tmp/cc.js "$CCBIN"
# for each prompt, check its longest pure-ASCII piece is present in /tmp/cc.js
# (see scripts usage / Part 3 escaping note). Near-total presence => essentially
# identical; the only expected misses are micro-prompts that are pure ${interpolation}
# with no static text long enough to fingerprint (nothing to mismatch).
```

To verify an **applied** un-nerf actually reached the binary (after `tweakcc
--apply`), unpack the *patched* binary and grep for un-nerf sentinels present and
stock sentinels gone:

```bash
# un-nerf present (expect >0):
grep -c "senior-engineer standard" /tmp/cc.js
grep -c "never trade away rigor, depth, or correctness" /tmp/cc.js
grep -c "Make your review thorough and complete" /tmp/cc.js
# stock gone (expect 0):
grep -c "introduce abstractions beyond what the task requires" /tmp/cc.js
```

`install.sh` automates exactly this and **fails loudly (leaving the binary clean)
on a no-op/partial apply** — never trust tweakcc's "applied successfully" message
alone; it can report success while patching nothing.

**Two benign-noise traps when re-applying** (both look like failures but aren't):

- **"Could not find system prompt …" ×dozens** — you ran `tweakcc --apply` against
  an **already-un-nerfed** binary, so tweakcc hunts for the *stock* text that the
  prior patch already replaced and can't find it. The un-nerf is fine; the apply is
  just a redundant no-op. `install.sh` avoids this by reinstalling a clean **stock**
  binary before every re-apply (it detects a prior un-nerf via [[the sentinels]] and
  `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@<ver>` overwrites the patched binary).
  Proof: from a pristine binary the flood is 0 warnings; from a patched one it's ~62.
- **"Customizations applied with some failures / open an issue"** — a bare `--apply`
  also runs tweakcc's *other* feature patches from your `~/.tweakcc/config.json`
  (Opusplan, session memory, model customizations, …). On a very fresh CC build some
  of those can't be located. That is **tweakcc's** to fix and is unrelated to the
  un-nerf — tweakcc itself prints "these do not affect your system prompt patches."
  `install.sh` verifies the un-nerf independently (sentinels) and says so.

---

## Part 8 — tweakcc operational reference

### Commands (confirmed)

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `tweakcc --apply` (bare) | **THE** system-prompt apply path. Patches every prompt whose `~/.tweakcc/system-prompts/*.md` differs from stock. Self-downloads `prompts-X.Y.Z.json`, self-creates `native-binary.backup`. |
| `tweakcc --apply --patches <ids>` | **NOT** for prompts — selects UI/theme/feature patches. Applies **zero** `.md` edits. Do not use it to apply un-nerfs. |
| `tweakcc unpack <out.js> <bin>` | Extract bundled JS from a binary (read-only, version-independent). The inspection/verify workhorse. |
| `tweakcc repack <in.js> <bin>` | Re-embed JS (as Bun bytecode; size balloons). |
| `tweakcc --restore` / `--revert` | Restore the binary from `native-binary.backup`. |
| `tweakcc --list-system-prompts [ver]` | List prompts known for a version. |

The interactive TUI extracts the full `.md` set from the binary, but **cannot be
scripted** (no TTY → the React app crashes; no non-interactive extraction flag).
Use `sync-version.mjs` (JSON) or `unpack` instead.

### The publish lag (the common blocker)

Both `sync-version.mjs --download` and `tweakcc --apply` need
`prompts-X.Y.Z.json`, which lags a fresh CC release by hours-to-days. When it's
missing (404):

- **Preferred: wait for the latest version's JSON.** Since we target only the
  latest, the simplest correct move is to re-run the happy path once
  `prompts-X.Y.Z.json` for your installed version publishes (usually within a day).
- **Stopgap only if you must ship now:** sync to the newest *published* version ≤
  installed and verify against the binary (Part 7). Treat it as temporary — re-sync
  to the latest as soon as its JSON is up; the manifest will flag whatever the
  interim version missed. Don't carry the interim version as a tracked target.
- **Applying to the binary must wait** for the matching JSON (tweakcc can't locate
  prompts without it). Build tweakcc from `main` to get the freshest CC support
  (`install.sh` does this by default); `main` carries prompt-locator/repack fixes
  before they're cut into an npm release.

### `~/.tweakcc/` layout — what to clear

`config.json` (settings + `ccVersion`), `system-prompts/*.md`,
`prompt-data-cache/prompts-X.Y.Z.json`, `systemPromptOriginalHashes.json`,
`systemPromptAppliedHashes.json`, `native-binary.backup` (~400 MB), and
`native-claudejs-{orig,patched}.js`.

A **stale** older-version state shadows new prompts. `install.sh` clears it for
you before staging — preserving `config.json` and **deleting** the rest,
including the ~400 MB `native-binary.backup` and the `native-claudejs` dumps.
This project keeps **no backups**: stock is always re-extractable and rollback is
a Claude Code reinstall, not `--restore`. By hand:

```bash
cd ~/.tweakcc || exit
for f in system-prompts prompt-data-cache systemPromptOriginalHashes.json \
         systemPromptAppliedHashes.json native-binary.backup \
         native-claudejs-orig.js native-claudejs-patched.js .unnerf-stale-*; do
  rm -rf "$f"
done
```

tweakcc won't overwrite an *edited* `.md`, so a clean extraction needs the
`system-prompts/` dir cleared first.

### Dead ends (don't repeat)

- `--apply --patches <ids>` to apply prompts → applies nothing.
- `adhoc-patch` for bulk prompt edits → matches raw bytes only, breaks on any
  escaped char.
- Trusting tweakcc's "applied" message → always `unpack`+grep to verify.
- A tweakcc older than `main` / 4.1.1 → mis-locates Latin-1 prompts and aborts
  the repack on a fresh CC build. Use `main` (what `install.sh` builds) or ≥ 4.1.1.

## Part 9 — Current state (v2.1.198)

We track **only the latest** Claude Code version whose prompt JSON tweakcc has
published. Replace this snapshot each sync rather than appending history.

- **Version:** built from **v2.1.198** — the latest CC release, and the newest
  tweakcc has prompt data for. (The prior sync stopped at v2.1.196 as a stopgap
  while v2.1.197's JSON lagged; v2.1.197 and v2.1.198 have since published, so this
  sync jumped straight to the latest.)
- **Scale:** **80 un-nerf rules across 62 files**, 540 prompts, `--check` clean.
- **Last sync (v2.1.196 → v2.1.198):** manifest delta — **36 changed, 22 added, 8
  removed** (482 unchanged; 526 → 540 prompts). Of the 22 added, **21 kept** and 1
  received the retargeted design flip (below). Kept covers the 9 new `data-*` blobs
  (7 data-visualization + plan-artifact template + diff-dialog schema), 7 new skills,
  and the worktree-shipping / shared-git-stash / code-review-artifact-publishing /
  project-skill-upkeep system-prompts — their only brevity phrases are
  structured-output or anti-padding formatting. The changed set is dominated by
  `data-managed-agents-*` API-reference refreshes (all `data-*` = keep) and the
  security-monitor prompts (safety content = keep). No new bucket-2/3 nerf.
- **One rule retired, one retargeted** — two different Part-6 drift rows:
  - **Retired** `system-prompt-agent-memory-instructions` — Anthropic removed the
    prompt outright; its "Write concise notes" flip is gone tree-wide (removed, not
    relocated → nothing to retarget).
  - **Retargeted** the Phase-2 design flip ("err on launching Plan agents").
    Anthropic split the single `system-reminder-plan-mode-is-active-5-phase` prompt
    into per-phase prompts; the design guidance now lives in the new standalone
    `system-reminder-plan-mode-phase-2-design`, where it is **literal static
    content** — so the `.md` patcher can still reach it (a retarget, not a retire).
    Contrast the v2.1.196 coordinator case, where the phrase moved into an
    *unreachable* `${VARIABLE}` value and had to be retired. The Phase-1 exploration
    flip stays in the (now Phase-1-only) 5-phase prompt.
- **Sibling audit (Part 6):** **0 un-ruled siblings** — every cross-file `stock`
  match is flipped (or transformed by the sibling's own rule) in both files, except
  the intentional `skill-model-migration-guide` keep (the "give a recommendation,
  not an exhaustive survey" line sits inside a sample prompt quoted for users —
  example content, not a directive to Claude).
- **Binary check (Part 7):** verified against the **installed v2.1.198 binary**
  (`tweakcc unpack` + fingerprint): **all 540 prompts byte-present** — 529 matched
  on a ≥20-char literal run, the other 11 are `${interpolation}`-dominated
  micro-prompts confirmed via their shorter literal segments. **Zero mismatches**:
  the JSON-derived stock is byte-identical to what's actually running.
