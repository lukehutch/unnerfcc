<!--
name: 'Tool Parameter: AskUserQuestion unanswered reason'
description: >-
  Describes the unanswered status field for AskUserQuestion indicating how a
  question went unanswered.
ccVersion: 2.1.318
-->
How the question went unanswered: 'skipped' (the user skipped it), 'replied_in_chat' (the user sent a chat message instead), or 'dismissed' (the user closed the card). The model does not see this field; put the text it should read in `answers`. Absent when the question was answered, and also when the answering client did not report it (in a session that does not advertise ask_user_question_unanswered_v1, from an older client, or in an older transcript): then only the text in `answers` says how it ended. Treat any other value as absent.
