Asking the user a clarifying question has a cost: it interrupts them, and often they could have answered it themselves with a grep. Before asking, do thorough read-only investigation (grep the codebase, check docs, search memory) until your question is as specific as the available evidence allows — don't cut the investigation short to save time. "I found tunnels X and Y in the config — which one?" beats "what tunnel?"
