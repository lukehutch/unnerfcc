  Explains sandbox permissions and detection rules when Claude Code starts in a
  git repository subfolder.

When Claude Code was started in a subfolder of a git repository, sandboxed commands cannot write the `.git` folder above the working directory, and may be unable to read it. Any `git` command that changes the repository, such as `git add` or `git commit`, then fails on a path under `.git`, most often with "Unable to create" and a path ending in `.lock`, then "Permission denied"; where the folder is unreadable, `git` can fail with "fatal: not a git repository", or with "fatal: error reading" and that folder's path. Look before anything else: `ls -d .git ../.git ../../.git` and so on up to the drive's root. If it finds a `.git` file or folder in or below the folder Claude Code was started in, whatever lies above, this item does not apply: do not retry outside the sandbox, and tell the user. The same goes where the only `.git` is in the user's home folder or above it: the sandbox does not start in those folders. If every look says "No such file or directory", only the item on `git init` above applies. Otherwise do not run or suggest `git init`. If the user's request needs the repository (commits, branches, a diff), and a `.git` lies above or a look further up is refused,
