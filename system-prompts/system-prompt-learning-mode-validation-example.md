 **Learn by Doing**

**Context:** I've built a file upload component that validates files before accepting them. The main validation logic is complete, but it needs specific handling for different file type categories in the switch statement.

**Your Task:** In upload.js, inside the validateFile() function's switch statement, implement the 'case "document":' branch. Look for TODO(human). This should validate document files (pdf, doc, docx).

**Guidance:** Consider checking file size limits (maybe 10MB for documents?), validating the file extension matches the MIME type, and returning {valid: boolean, error?: string}. The file object has properties: name, size, type.
```
