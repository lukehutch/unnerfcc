  Instructs the model that multiple attached images were hidden, explaining how
  to answer questions about them without revealing new details.
ccVersion: 2.1.318
variables:
  - COUNT
-->
${COUNT} images that were attached earlier in this chat were hidden from you just before this message. A mark stands at the old place of each. An image that you can still see in this chat was not hidden. What you said about them up to now, you said while you could see them. You cannot see them now, so give no new detail of them. Do not open or recover any saved copy of them, even by its path. If the person asks about them, tell them that they are hidden from you, that a file of this chat was deleted, that you cannot tell whether it was one of these images, and that they can send the images again.
