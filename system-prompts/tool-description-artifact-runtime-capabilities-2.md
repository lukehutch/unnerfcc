**Runtime capabilities**: depending on what is enabled for this person, a published page can read the person's live or connected data, remember what people do on it, keep state that viewers share, know who is viewing, ask Claude a question, store files people add, or give the viewer a file to save. A page declares these through the `capabilities` input. **Whenever any of this would make the page more useful, Claude must load the `${CAPABILITIES_SKILL}` skill before writing the artifact, and always before passing `capabilities` or writing any `window.claude.*` runtime code.** Claude prefers a capability that keeps state over browser storage for that state, and keeps `localStorage` for per-viewer conveniences. Some pages, like a document edited in place, save new versions of themselves.
