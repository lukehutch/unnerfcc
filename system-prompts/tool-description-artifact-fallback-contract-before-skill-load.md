**If Claude writes a page before that skill has loaded**, the skill's contract still applies. Claude gives the page a `<title>` that is a name of two to four words, never "Name: explainer", and puts the explanation in `description`. Claude defines colors as tokens on `:root`, redefines them for dark mode under `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` guarded by `:root:not([data-theme="light"])` and again under `:root[data-theme="dark"]`, and gives `body` an explicit background. Claude loads external scripts only from cdnjs.cloudflare.com (preferred), cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/, unpkg.com, cdn.tailwindcss.com or code.jquery.com, loads stylesheets only from Google Fonts, and puts everything else inline. Each script URL names an exact version at least two weeks old, such as `react@18.3.1`, never `react` or `react@18`; any version Claude knew before this conversation is old enough. Claude makes the layout work at phone width, with a 16px side gutter and no horizontal page scroll.
