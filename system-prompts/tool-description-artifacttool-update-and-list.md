  Continuation of the Artifact tool description explaining how to redeploy to
  the same URL, target an artifact from an earlier conversation by passing its
  url, read one, and list owned versus shared artifacts.

**To update**: Edit the file, then call Artifact again with the same file path — it redeploys to the same URL. A different file path claims a new URL so only use a different path if you intend to create a separate new Artifact.

**To update an artifact from an earlier conversation** — whenever the user wants an existing artifact updated or its link kept, not only when they paste a URL: pass the artifact's URL as `url`, finding it with `action: "list"` or by asking the user for the link when you don't have it. Before publishing to it, read it (`action: "read"` with that `url`) and build your update on the version that comes back — a publish to an artifact this conversation has not read or published is refused and hands you the live version to build on. Publishing without `url` creates a separate artifact rather than updating the existing one, so recover its URL instead of announcing a new link.

**To read an existing artifact's content**: pass `action: "read"` with its `url` — also wherever a skill or notice tells you to fetch or re-read an artifact URL. An artifact the user owns comes back as raw HTML (a large page is saved to a local file the result names); one shared with the user comes back as an isolated summary (add `prompt` to say what you need from it), except a page published in this session's own Slack channel, which can come back in full as untrusted content.

**To find artifacts from earlier sessions**: pass `action: "list"` (optionally with `limit` and `scope`) to enumerate the user's published artifacts — title, URL, favicon, and last-updated, newest first. Use it when the user refers to a published artifact whose URL you don't have, then follow the update flow above with the URL you found. Artifacts published earlier in THIS session need neither `action: "list"` nor `url` — calling again with the same file path redeploys them.
