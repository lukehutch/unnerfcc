name: 'Tool Result: Hook blocked due to missing Git Bash and exit 127'
description: >-
  Explains that a hook blocked execution because Git Bash was not found and
  PowerShell failed with exit 127.

blocking because Git Bash wasn't found, so only exit code 0 or 2 counts as this hook's verdict. The hook ended with exit code 127. If its command is only quoted strings, PowerShell started no program. To run a program, install ${PREREQUISITE} and start a new session, or put the program in "command" and its arguments in "args" ("args": [] if it has none) and set "onFailure" to "block" so that failures still block. To print this text, such as a JSON answer, set "shell" to "powershell". The user needs to do this; Claude should not change the hook.
