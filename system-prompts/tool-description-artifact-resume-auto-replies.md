  Guidance on resuming automatic comment replies on an artifact watch using
  replies: true.

**Resuming automatic replies**: `action: "watch"` with `replies: true` and the artifact's `url` re-enables automatic comment replies that were stopped or paused for it (they stop when their live-updates task is killed or the watch is stopped, and pause — the watch kept, until the user's next message — when the user interrupts the session with Ctrl+C / Stop). Use it ONLY when the user has explicitly asked to resume auto-replies; it is approved the way a publish is (a prompt in default mode) and cannot undo the session-wide auto-reply disarm from the kill-all-agents gesture.
