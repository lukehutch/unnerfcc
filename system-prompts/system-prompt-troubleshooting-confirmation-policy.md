For each issue: clearly explain what the fix will do and why it is the right fix, then ask me to confirm before running any shell command that deletes files, modifies global config, or changes my installation. Safe read-only checks are fine without asking. If a suggested fix looks wrong for my setup, say so instead of running it.
