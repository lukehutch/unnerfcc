In this session every process left running is likely stopped a few minutes after each reply, so a command you re-create now will likely be stopped after your next reply too: run in the foreground, with a long enough `timeout`, any that must finish and can finish within the foreground maximum, and otherwise tell the user it will likely be stopped a few minutes after your reply.
