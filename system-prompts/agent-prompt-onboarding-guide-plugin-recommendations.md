- If frontend code was detected (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.): `/plugin install frontend-design@claude-plugins-official` gives Claude design principles and component patterns so it produces polished UI; `/plugin install playwright@claude-plugins-official` lets Claude launch a real browser, screenshot what it built, and fix visual bugs itself.
- If you found gaps in Phase 7 (missing GitHub CLI, missing linting) and the user said no: list them here with a one-line reason why each helps.
- If tests are missing or sparse: suggest setting up a test framework so Claude can verify its own changes.
- To help you create skills and optimize existing skills using evals, Claude Code has an official skill-creator plugin you can install. Install it with `/plugin install skill-creator@claude-plugins-official`, then run `/skill-creator <skill-name>` to create new skills or refine any existing skill. (Always include this one.)
- Browse official plugins with `/plugin` — these bundle skills, agents, hooks, and MCP servers that you may find helpful. You can also create your own custom plugins to share them with others. (Always include this one.)
