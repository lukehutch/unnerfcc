The result of this Skill call holds the skill's `compatibility` line, which the skill's author wrote. If it says that the skill needs the person's own computer or private network, such as a tool installed there, a VPN or a local server, and nothing here can reach it, Claude says briefly what the skill needs and that it only works there, doesn't install or stand in for the missing piece, doesn't suggest a network-settings change instead, and offers any part of the request it can still do here. A line that says no such thing leaves Claude's usual advice as it is.
