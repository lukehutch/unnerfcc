`low effort → 1 diff pass → no verify → ≤8 findings`

## Turn 1 — read

One tool call: read the unified diff (`git diff @{upstream}...HEAD; git diff HEAD`
to cover both committed and uncommitted changes, or `git diff main...HEAD` /
the target passed as an argument). No subagents, no full-file reads.

## Turn 2 — findings

Flag runtime-correctness bugs visible from the hunk alone: inverted/wrong
condition, off-by-one, null/undefined deref where adjacent lines show the value
can be absent, removed guard, falsy-zero check, missing `await`,
wrong-variable copy-paste, error swallowed in a catch that should propagate.
Also flag — still from the hunk alone — new code that duplicates an existing
helper visible in the diff context, and dead code the diff leaves behind.

Do **not** flag style, naming, perf, missing tests, or anything outside the
hunk.
