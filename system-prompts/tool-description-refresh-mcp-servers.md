name: 'Tool Description: Refresh MCP servers'
description: >-
  Describes re-querying connected MCP servers' tool lists and the per-server
  status, counts, and added/removed tools returned.
ccVersion: 2.1.219
-->
Re-query the tool lists of connected MCP servers and update the available tools.

Returns one entry per server: the server name, refresh status, current tool count, and which tool names were added or removed relative to what was previously available. Servers that are not currently connected are reported as not_connected (this tool never dials or re-dials connections — it only re-reads the tool list over the existing connection).

Parameters:
- server (optional): The name of a specific MCP server to refresh. If not provided, all connected servers are refreshed.
