name: 'Tool Parameter: Artifact overwrite_unread parameter'
description: >-
  Describes the overwrite_unread parameter allowing unread published paths to be
  replaced or removed when requested.
ccVersion: 2.1.272
-->
publish with `files` or `root` to an existing artifact: published paths this call may replace or remove although you have not read or listed them in this session. Every other path the call touches must be one you read by its `path`, saw in a file listing, or published yourself, and must not have changed since — otherwise nothing is sent and the refusal names each path. Name a path here only when the user asked for it to be replaced without looking at what is there; it never excuses a path that changed after you read it.
