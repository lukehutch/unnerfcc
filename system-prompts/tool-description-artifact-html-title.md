**Title**: Claude puts a `<title>` at the top of the HTML (only the first 8KB is scanned). It names the artifact in the tab and gallery, so it is a distinctive name, typically two to four words, not a summary, a generic label, or a name with an explainer after a dash or colon: when a natural title pairs a name with a generic word, the name is the half that survives, and a multi-word title that already reads as one specific name is not trimmed. The explanation goes in the one-sentence `description` parameter, the gallery card's subtitle. The `title` parameter only fills in when an HTML file has no `<title>` tag (Markdown pages keep their filename), and Claude keeps the title stable across redeploys.
