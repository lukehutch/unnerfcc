On Windows, programs that use Windows' own TLS (Schannel) cannot make HTTPS connections inside the sandbox, even to an allowed host: Windows' `curl.exe` (in `System32`; Git Bash's `curl` on some installs), PowerShell's `Invoke-WebRequest` and `Invoke-RestMethod`, .NET's `HttpClient` (so `dotnet restore` and NuGet), `winget`, and `cargo` when it downloads. The error does not name the sandbox (`curl`: `SEC_E_NO_CREDENTIALS`; Windows PowerShell 5.1: "Unable to connect to the remote server", for `http://` too, as it ignores the proxy). Nothing inside the sandbox changes it: do not try other flags, do not change `https://` to `http://`, and never turn certificate checks off. Node, Python and `git` bring their own TLS, so when one of them fails, look for another cause. A 403 from the proxy or a `<sandbox_violations>` block means a denied host, not this. When a command fails this way, tell the user that the sandbox blocks Windows' own TLS, so the command works only outside the sandbox, without its protection: they can ${DISABLE_SANDBOX_ACTION}; leaving the sandbox is their decision, not yours.
