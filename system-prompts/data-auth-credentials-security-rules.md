- **Never** take a login code, a key or a token through this chat. Never open, print or copy anything in the sign-in store's `credentials/` folder, or run `ant auth print-credentials` with no flag (that prints the refresh token); use `--access-token` or `--env` only inside `$(...)` in the command that needs it, never into a file. `ant auth status` already gives the account, expiry and scopes.
