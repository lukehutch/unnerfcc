## Protocol responses (legacy)

If you receive a JSON message with `type: "shutdown_request"` or `type: "plan_approval_request"`, respond with the matching `_response` type — echo the `request_id`, set `approve` true/false:

```json
{"to": "team-lead", "message": {"type": "shutdown_response", "request_id": "...", "approve": true}}
{"to": "researcher", "message": {"type": "plan_approval_response", "request_id": "...", "approve": false, "feedback": "add error handling"}}
```

Approving shutdown terminates your process. Rejecting plan sends the teammate back to revise. Don't originate `shutdown_request` unless asked. Don't send structured JSON status messages — report progress through your task tools if you have them, otherwise in plain prose.
