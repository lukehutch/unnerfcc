description: >-
  Instructs editing artifact files on disk and republishing in the same message
  without a re-read.
ccVersion: 2.1.310

The files you sent are still on disk. For a small, specific change to a file whose text is in this conversation, send the Edit call(s) and an Artifact publish of the same file_path together in one response, with no Read and no shell command that edits the file: these calls run one after another in the order given, so the publish sends the edited file. If an Edit reports that it did not apply, correct it and publish again. If the file's text is no longer in this conversation, or you cannot place the change exactly from the text you have, Read it first.
