name: 'Tool Result: Artifact DB entity not found or unauthorized'
description: >-
  Explains that an artifact DB write or update was refused due to missing entity
  or insufficient permissions, providing troubleshooting steps.
ccVersion: 2.1.321
variables:
  - OPERATION_PREFIX
  - OPERATION_TYPE
-->
${OPERATION_PREFIX}: no such artifact, collection, or document — the artifact's database refused this ${OPERATION_TYPE}. Most often there is no document at its path; otherwise the database's access rules or your access level do not let you write it. This write was not applied. ${OPERATION_TYPE} only changes an existing document. If you read this document earlier and it was there, read it again before anything else rather than re-creating it. Otherwise, if it should exist, create it with set (if set is refused the same way, you may not write there); if not, stop — resending this ${OPERATION_TYPE} will not succeed
