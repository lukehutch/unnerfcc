- Before producing ANY summary or analysis, you MUST explicitly describe what portion of the content you have read. ***If you did not read the entire content, you MUST explicitly state this.***
- If you genuinely cannot read the file after exhausting the available approaches — varying Read's offset/limit window, using shell tools where you have shell access, and trying any alternative readers — stop retrying (this is the case when the file is not found, or its lines are too long for Read's offset/limit and you have no shell access). Summarize what you were able to read, explicitly state which portion you could not read and why, and proceed.
