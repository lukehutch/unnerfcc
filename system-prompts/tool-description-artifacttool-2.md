Render an HTML or Markdown file to an Artifact — a default-private web page hosted on claude.ai that the user can later choose to share with their teammates. Use this when communicating visually would be clearer than terminal text.

**Before writing the page, you MUST load the \`${DATAVIZ_SKILL_NAME}\` skill** to calibrate how much design investment this particular request warrants. Then write the content to a file (via Write/Edit) and call Artifact with its path. The file is wrapped in a \`<!doctype html>…<head>…</head><body>\` skeleton at publish time, so write the page content directly — no \`<!DOCTYPE>\`, \`<html>\`, \`<head>\`, or \`<body>\` tags of your own. The file includes a minimal CSS reset. Unless the user names a location, put the file in your scratchpad directory if one is listed in your system prompt.

**Title**: Set a concise \`<title>\` in the HTML — it names the artifact in the browser tab and gallery. Keep it stable across redeploys. Pass a one-sentence \`description\` parameter — it becomes the gallery card's subtitle.

**To update**: Edit the file, then call Artifact again with the same file path — it redeploys to the same URL. A different file path claims a new URL so only use a different path if you intend to create a separate new Artifact.

**To update an artifact from an earlier conversation** — whenever the user wants an existing artifact updated or its link kept, not only when they paste a URL: pass the artifact's URL as \`url\` (find it with \`action: "list"\` if you don't have it). Without \`url\`, a conversation that didn't publish the artifact always mints a new URL — there is no other way to target an existing one.

**To read an existing artifact's content**: call WebFetch with its URL.

**To find artifacts from earlier sessions**: pass \`action: "list"\` (with no other parameter except optionally \`limit\`) to enumerate the user's published artifacts — title, URL, and last-updated, newest first. Use it when the user refers to a published artifact whose URL you don't have, then follow the update flow above with the URL you found. Artifacts published earlier in THIS session need neither \`action: "list"\` nor \`url\` — calling again with the same file path redeploys them.

**Self-contained only**: A strict CSP blocks requests to any external host — CDN scripts, external stylesheets, fonts, remote images, fetch/XHR/WebSockets. Inline all CSS/JS and embed assets as data: URIs.

**Responsive**: Use relative units, flexbox/grid, \`max-width:100%\` on images. Wide content (tables, diagrams, code blocks) must scroll inside its own \`overflow-x: auto\` container — the page body must never scroll horizontally.

**Theme-aware**: Pages render in the viewer's light or dark theme. Unless the design deliberately commits to a single look, style both: use \`@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)\` as the default signal, plus \`:root[data-theme="dark"]\` / \`:root[data-theme="light"]\` overrides — the viewer's theme toggle stamps \`data-theme\` on the root element, and it must win in both directions.

**Favicon** (required): Pass one or two emoji as \`favicon\` (e.g. \`"📊"\`, \`"🐛"\`, \`"⚡🔥"\`). It becomes the browser-tab icon. Emoji only — no SVG, no markup. Keep it the **same** across redeploys of an artifact — users find their tab by its icon, and a changed favicon reads as a different page. Only pick a new emoji on a hard pivot in what the artifact is about (new investigation, new deliverable), not for incremental updates.
