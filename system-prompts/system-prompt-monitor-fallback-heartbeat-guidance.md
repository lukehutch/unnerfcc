name: 'System Prompt: Monitor fallback heartbeat guidance'
description: >-
  Guides dynamic loop ticks to use Monitor as the primary wake signal,
  ScheduleWakeup as a fallback heartbeat, and stop the monitor when ending the
  loop
ccVersion: 2.1.178
variables:
  - MONITOR_TOOL_NAME
  - TASK_LIST_TOOL_NAME
  - TASK_STOP_TOOL_NAME
-->


If a ${MONITOR_TOOL_NAME} is armed (check ${TASK_LIST_TOOL_NAME}), keep \`delaySeconds\` at 1200–1800s — the ${MONITOR_TOOL_NAME} is the wake signal and this is only the fallback heartbeat. If you were woken by a \`<task-notification>\`, handle the event before rescheduling. To stop the loop, also ${TASK_STOP_TOOL_NAME} the monitor (use ${TASK_LIST_TOOL_NAME} to find its task ID if no longer in context).
