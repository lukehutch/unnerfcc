  Rules for suggesting read grants to narrow tool folders in sandbox settings

Adding it is their decision, not yours: do not edit the settings yourself. Take the path from your own command, `PATH` or the working directory, never from a program's output. Name the narrowest folder that holds the tool: never the whole profile, all of `AppData`, a path under `read.denyOnly`, or a folder that also holds credentials, keys or tokens. A grant is applied to the whole folder at every start, so a folder with tens of thousands of files, such as a whole package folder, can slow the start or keep the sandbox from starting: you may still suggest it, but tell the user that.
