  Explains when comment auto-replies wake the local session on watched
  artifacts.

 A comment sent to Claude on a watched artifact wakes this session only while that artifact's `status` row says auto-replies armed. A publish arms that when comment auto-replies are on for this session; so does `action: "watch"` on an artifact the person can edit whose link they gave in their own message. Plain comments never notify this session; Claude reads them with `action: "comments"` when the person asks.
