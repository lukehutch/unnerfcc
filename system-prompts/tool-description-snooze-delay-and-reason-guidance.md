  Opening of the /loop dynamic-mode ScheduleWakeup (snooze) tool description —
  schedule the next iteration without polling harness-tracked work, pass the
  /loop prompt or autonomous-loop sentinel back each turn, and end the loop with
  stop:true.
ccVersion: 2.1.217

Schedule when to resume work in /loop dynamic mode — the user invoked /loop without an interval, asking you to self-pace iterations of a specific task.

Do NOT schedule a short-interval wakeup to poll for background work you started — when harness-tracked work finishes, you are re-invoked automatically, so polling is wasted. Instead schedule a long fallback (1200s+) so the loop survives if the work hangs or never notifies. The exception is external work the harness cannot track (a CI run, a deploy, a remote queue) — there, pick a delay matched to how fast that state actually changes.

Pass the same /loop prompt back via \`prompt\` each turn so the next firing repeats the task. For an autonomous /loop (no user prompt), pass the literal sentinel \`${"<<autonomous-loop-dynamic>>"}\` as \`prompt\` instead — the runtime resolves it back to the autonomous-loop instructions at fire time. (There is a similar \`${"<<autonomous-loop>>"}\` sentinel for CronCreate-based autonomous loops; do not confuse the two — ${"ScheduleWakeup"} always uses the \`-dynamic\` variant.) To end the loop, call this tool with \`stop: true\` (omit every other field) — the loop ends immediately and no further wakeups fire.
