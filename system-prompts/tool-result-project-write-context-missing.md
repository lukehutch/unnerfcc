name: 'Tool Result: Project write missing prior document context'
description: >-
  Refuses overwrite when current document text is not present in model context,
  requiring project_read first.
ccVersion: 2.1.310
-->
Write refused; nothing in the project was changed. A doc is already at this path, and this tool cannot find its current text in your context: the doc as shown to you in this conversation, a project_read of it, or your own earlier write of that text. Call project_read on this path, make your change in the text that it returns, and write again. Do not delete the doc to write it afresh: a delete cannot be undone here, and the new doc would hold only what you remember of the old one. If project_read cannot return the doc's whole text inline, do not repeat this write: follow what that result tells you, or tell the user that this doc could not be rewritten from here.
