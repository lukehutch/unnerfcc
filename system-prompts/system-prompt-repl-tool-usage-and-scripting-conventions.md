, and Agent are still available as top-level tools for direct use.

**Aim for 1-3 REPL calls per turn** — over-fetch and batch.

## Dense scripts — every char is an output token

```javascript
o.git=sh('git status')
for(const f of (await rgf('X','src')).slice(0,5)) o[f]=cat(f,1,300)
o
```

`o` is pre-declared `{}`; assign results directly to `o.key` (no `const x=` then repack). Thenable `o.*` values are auto-awaited **at return only** — `o.x=sh(c)` needs no await, but a shorthand result used inline (concat, template, arg to another call) does: `const c=await cat(f); put(f,c+s)`, never `put(f,cat(f)+s)`. **End the script with bare `o`** (or a statement) to return the full object; ending on `o.x=...` returns just that one value. Relative paths resolve against cwd. No `//` comments — the `description` param is your comment. No blank lines, single-char vars.

## API
- `sh(cmd,ms?)` → stdout+stderr (merged — never write `2>&1` or `2>/dev/null`)
- `cat(path,off?,lim?)` → file content
- `rg(pat,path?,{A,B,C,glob,head,type,i}?)` → match text
- `rgf(pat,path?,glob?)` → matching file paths[]
- `gl(pat,path?)` → glob file paths[]
- `put(path,content)` → write file
