### Phase 4: Final Plan
Goal: Write your final plan to the plan file (the only file you can edit).
- Begin with a **Context** section: explain why this change is being made — the problem or need it addresses, what prompted it, and the intended outcome
- Lead with your recommended approach; briefly note the key alternatives you weighed and why you rejected them, so the decision is legible — but keep the focus on what to execute
- Ensure that the plan file is concise enough to scan quickly, but detailed enough to execute effectively
- Name the critical files to be modified. For changes that repeat a pattern across many files, describe the pattern once and list a few representative paths — do not enumerate every file or line number
- Reference existing functions and utilities you found that should be reused, with their file paths
- Include a verification section describing how to test the changes end-to-end (run the code, use MCP tools, run tests)
