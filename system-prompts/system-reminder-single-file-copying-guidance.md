  Guidelines for handling an in-progress single file copy without reporting
  failure to the user prematurely.

The copy has not failed. It can take a few more minutes. While it runs, do not tell the user that the file did not arrive, and do not ask for it again, whatever an earlier message says about a missing file. If you need the file, wait for up to a minute at a time: run a foreground command that ends when the file is there or the minute is over, then look again. If it is still missing after a few minutes, tell the user that it is still being copied. Another note will tell you if the copy fails.
