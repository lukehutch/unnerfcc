name: 'Tool Result: Project write if_version mismatch refused'
description: >-
  Refuses write because if_version does not match the last full text seen in the
  conversation, advising re-reading.
ccVersion: 2.1.321
-->
Write refused; nothing in the project was changed. if_version does not name the copy of this doc that this write is checked against: the last whole text of it that you were shown or typed in this conversation (for a write from a file, also the last one read to or written from a file). Call project_read on this path, make your change from what it returns, and write again without if_version.
