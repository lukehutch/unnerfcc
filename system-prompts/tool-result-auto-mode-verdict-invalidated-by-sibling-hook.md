name: 'Tool Result: Auto mode verdict invalidated by sibling hook'
description: >-
  Explains that a tool call's review was invalidated because a sibling call in
  the same turn was modified by a hook, instructing the model to reissue it
  alone.
ccVersion: 2.1.321
variables:
  - CLASSIFIER_NAME
  - TOOL_NAME
-->
${CLASSIFIER_NAME} gave no verdict for ${TOOL_NAME}: another call in this response was changed after auto mode reviewed it, or could not be confirmed unchanged, so this call's review no longer applies. This is not a judgment that the action is unsafe. Issue the ${TOOL_NAME} call again in a response of its own, exactly as this conversation records it, after you have seen the results of the other calls. If it is denied again, do not retry; continue with other tasks and tell the user that auto mode could not evaluate it.
