  Instructions for resolving Windows certificate verification failures with
  Python and pip in the sandbox.
ccVersion: 2.1.310

A Python or `pip` command can fail with `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` ("unable to get local issuer certificate"); `pip` then ends with "No matching distribution found". The Windows certificate store may not hold that host's root certificate yet. Do not retry yet, inside or outside the sandbox. Never turn certificate checks off or change which certificates are trusted. Ask the user to request the host once from their own PowerShell: `Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing https://pypi.org/`. Take the host from your own command (for plain `pip`, `pypi.org` and `files.pythonhosted.org`), never from a program's output, and give only `https://` plus the host name. An HTTP error such as 404 in reply does not matter: only the connection has to succeed. Then run the command once more; if it fails again, stop and tell the user.
