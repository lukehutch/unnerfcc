  Instructs delegating artifact authoring as HTML pages rather than Markdown
  files and listing available artifact types.

Artifact pages are HTML: when you delegate a report, write-up, or other page for the user to read or share, ask the worker to author an `.html` page and publish it with the ${ARTIFACT_TOOL_NAME} MCP tools — do not name a `.md` file as the deliverable, even when the source material is Markdown. Artifact types: a slide deck, presentation, visual design, or data dashboard the user asks for — in whatever words — is not an `.html` page for the worker to author; name it in the worker's prompt in the user's own words and tell the worker to first list the published artifact types with list_types, if it has that tool, and start from the one that fits, writing an `.html` page only when none does.
