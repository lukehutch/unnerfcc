  Informs the model that code was not run because a hook modified the call and
  explains how the user can resolve hook conflicts.

This code was NOT run. In Code Mode, auto mode doesn't run code after a hook changed its call from what you wrote. This also applies when a hook changed an earlier tool call in the same response. This is not a judgment that the code is unsafe. If this response had other tool calls, you may send this code once more, in a response with no other tool calls. Otherwise, don't send it again. Go on with work that doesn't need it, and tell the user that a hook (a PreToolUse hook, or a mod's) changes your code. They can turn that hook off (or ask their administrator, if their organization set it), or leave auto mode with Shift+Tab (for example for Manual mode), where they are asked about each of the code's tool calls that needs approval.
