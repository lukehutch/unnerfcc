description: >-
  Describes adding a directory as a working-directory root, the
  strict-subdirectory requirement, and the error returned for already-registered
  directories.
ccVersion: 2.1.219
-->
Add a directory as a working-directory root and optionally reload CLAUDE.md, skills, and plugins. The directory must resolve to a strict subdirectory of cwd, or of a directory passed at launch via --add-dir / the SDK additionalDirectories option. A directory that is already a registered working directory (including a duplicate of an earlier request) is denied with an error; the registration pipeline and DirectoryAdded hooks do not re-run.
