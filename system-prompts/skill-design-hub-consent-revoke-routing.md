description: >-
  Table row telling the /design hub to hand `consent` and `revoke` back to the
  dedicated commands and stop, never treating the word as a design brief.
ccVersion: 2.1.219
-->
| `consent` or `revoke` | Ask the user to run `/design consent` or `/design revoke` themselves — the dedicated commands manage the durable agent-access grant, and are available only with a first-party claude.ai login and a policy that permits Design access; if this session lacks those, say that instead. Do not treat the word as a design brief, and stop. |
