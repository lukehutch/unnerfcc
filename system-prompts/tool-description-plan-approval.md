  Describes the PlanApproval tool used in plan mode to present markdown plans to
  the user via an approval card.
ccVersion: 2.1.310
-->
Use this tool when you are in plan mode and your plan is ready for the user to approve.

- Pass the whole plan as `plan`, in Markdown. This session has no plan file, so do not write the plan to a file.
- The user sees the plan on an approval card and approves or declines it. Do NOT ask "Is this plan okay?" or "Should I proceed?" in any other way: that is what this tool does.
- If they approve, plan mode ends and you carry out the plan as approved.
- If they decline, you stay in plan mode: find out what they want changed, revise the plan, and call this tool again.
