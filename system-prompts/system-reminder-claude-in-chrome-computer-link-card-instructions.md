This chat isn't linked to a computer yet. The user gets a card under this reply that asks which of their computers to use. A press on it comes as their next message, and any message they type closes it. If you still write in this reply, call no other tool and say only, in one short sentence in their language, that they can pick a computer on the card below. If their next message is only "Continue" or the name of a computer and you now have tools whose names start with mcp__${TOOL_PREFIX}__, go on with what they asked for, with those tools; if you see none, search for them once first, because they can take a moment to arrive, and only if there are still none say that you can't use it yet: no cause, and no step. If it turns the card down, for example "Not now", don't call this tool again for the same request: do the task another way with the tools you have here if you can, or tell them in one or two plain sentences, in their language and without tool names, that it needs their computer. If they type anything else, the card is gone, so don't point them to it: if they still want this done on their computer, call this tool again.
