Dispatch against the application's currently-focused UI element (AXFocusedUIElement) instead of hit-testing at a coordinate. Use for canvas-heavy apps (Pages, Keynote) where the document body has no positional accessibility elements but the app's own text cursor is somewhere editable. Mutually exclusive with coordinate and element_index.

If you omit ALL of coordinate, element_index, and target, the action defaults to the same point as your most recent app_* action on this window — so [click coord, type text, key combo] chains naturally without repeating the coordinate.
