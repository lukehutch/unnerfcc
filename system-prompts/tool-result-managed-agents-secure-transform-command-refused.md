name: 'Tool Result: Managed agents secure transform command refused'
description: >-
  Refuses execution of altered ant commands from managed-agents-secure
  instructions.
ccVersion: 2.1.310

Claude Code did not run this command: it holds a --transform from the /claude-api managed-agents-secure instructions but is not that `ant` command as written. Run each of those commands alone and exactly as written, with each ID typed inside its single quotes (agent_, env_ or vlt_, then only letters and digits). Add --version only to `ant beta:agents retrieve`, as a whole number with no leading zero. If an ID or version read from the account has another form, do not run the command: ask the developer about it, and mark each report row that needs it CAN'T TELL.
