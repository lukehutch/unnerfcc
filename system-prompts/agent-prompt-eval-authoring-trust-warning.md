  Instructs the eval-authoring interviewer to verify user trust before adding
  --trust-plugin to pilot commands.

TRUST: this plugin directory is not yet trusted for `claude plugin eval` runs, and a pilot run started from this session cannot stop to ask. Before the first pilot run, tell the user plainly that piloting loads the plugin (its skills, hooks and MCP servers) and runs its eval suite on this machine as them, and ask whether they trust this plugin directory for that. Only on an explicit yes add `--trust-plugin` to the pilot commands below; on a no, or no answer, still write the case files but do not pilot them (say so in your summary). Never add `--trust-plugin` on your own judgement.
