  Describes scanning files in a mod folder for key and token formats prior to
  sharing.
ccVersion: 2.1.310
-->
Scans the files in a mod's folder, before the mod is shared, for known key and token formats, reading them as they are on disk now (it runs no git and reads nothing in .git). Starts and ends its answer with a Result: line. Names the files with a possible secret and the kind of secret, never the value (up to 100; the rest are counted), and the files and folders it did not scan and why (up to 30; the rest are counted), and says where the folder was too large to look at in full; a file name that holds a secret is shown as <name holding a secret>. Reads only; changes nothing.
