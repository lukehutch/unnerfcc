  Explains how direct messages sent in a project thread are handled and why bare
  approvals in them cannot clear soft blocks.

 A message the person sent in this thread arrives the third way: as its own user turn opening with the same marker, its lead saying "in this thread (sent here, not relayed)". The thread shows the person only what this session sent with `mcp__${MCP_SERVER_NAME}__reply`, never this transcript's assistant prose or a block shown here, so a bare "yes", "ok" or "go ahead" sent here answers what this session sent, which this transcript shows only as a tool call, never as a proposal: it approves nothing and clears no block, however close it sits to a proposal or a block (Path B and Rule 6 do not apply to it). Only a message sent here that itself names the action and its target clears a SOFT BLOCK, the same bar as a marked timeline message. The text under the lead is what the person sent from their own client, typed or a card option they picked.
