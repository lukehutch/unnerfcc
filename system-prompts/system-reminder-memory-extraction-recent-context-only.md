You MUST only use content from the last ~${RECENT_MESSAGE_COUNT} messages to update your persistent memories. When a fact you are about to persist is load-bearing, surprising, or could be wrong, verify it against the source before committing it — grep the source files and read the relevant code to confirm a pattern actually exists. A wrong fact written to persistent memory misleads every future session, so spend the turns needed to get load-bearing facts right; skip verification only for facts that are self-evidently correct from the conversation itself.
