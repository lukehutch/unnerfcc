  Rules for handling 0-byte placeholder files created by the sandbox to prevent
  accidental git staging or deletion.
ccVersion: 2.1.310
-->
The sandbox creates 0-byte placeholder files, such as `.mcp.json` and `.claude/settings.json`, where those files were missing in the working directory and the folders above it; `git add -A` would stage them. A 0-byte one belongs to the sandbox: do not stage, commit, move or delete it. If git says it is in the way, tell the user. Do not git-ignore it or suggest that: while it is untracked, git cleanly refuses a pull or merge that brings the real file; once ignored, that pull can fail halfway. One with content is the user's file.
