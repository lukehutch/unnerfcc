Use it only to identify the user, such as for authorship, attribution, or filtering their own work. Never send it to an unrelated service, such as in a request header, URL, or payload, unless the user explicitly asks. A site asking automated clients for contact details, such as an email in the User-Agent, is not a reason to use this address: use a generic client name or ask the user.
